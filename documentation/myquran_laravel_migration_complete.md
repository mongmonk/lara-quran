- ✅ Migrated all static assets (images, fonts, audio, JavaScript, CSS)

### Cache Management System
- ✅ Implemented CacheService for file-based caching
- ✅ Created caching methods with file modification time checks
- ✅ Set up directory structure in storage/app/cache/

### Data Layer
- ✅ Refactored QuranModel with file caching
- ✅ Implemented all data methods from original CodeIgniter model
- ✅ Migrated all JSON data files to storage/app/cache/

### Controller Layer
- ✅ Created QuranController with all Quran-related methods
- ✅ Created HaditsController with all Hadits-related methods
- ✅ Created BotController for Telegram bot functionality
- ✅ Created WelcomeController for authentication and general pages

### View Layer
- ✅ Migrated all AMP views to resources/views/amp/
- ✅ Migrated all bot views to resources/views/bot/
- ✅ Created all necessary Blade templates

### API Integration
- ✅ Implemented Alquran.cloud API integration
- ✅ Implemented MyQuran.com API integration
- ✅ Implemented Equran.id API integration
- ✅ Implemented Telegram API integration

### Search Functionality
- ✅ Implemented Quran text search
- ✅ Implemented Hadits text search

### Testing
- ✅ Tested all routes and functionality
- ✅ Verified data integrity

## Key Features Implemented

### File-Based Caching
All data operations now use file-based caching with JSON files instead of a database:
- Quran data stored in `storage/app/cache/quran/`
- Hadits data stored in `storage/app/cache/hadits/`
- Prayer data stored in `storage/app/cache/prayers/`
- Location data stored in `storage/app/cache/locations/`

### Controllers
1. **QuranController** - Handles all Quran-related functionality:
   - Surah, Juz, Ayah, Ruku, and Page views
   - Tafsir and search functionality
   - Prayer schedules and related features

2. **HaditsController** - Handles all Hadits-related functionality:
   - Bukhari, Muslim, Abu Daud, Ahmad, Darimi, Ibnu Majah, Malik, Nasai, Tirmidzi collections
   - Search functionality for Hadits

3. **BotController** - Handles Telegram bot functionality:
   - Index, Ayah, Juz, Surah, and Tafsir views
   - User interaction tracking

4. **WelcomeController** - Handles authentication and general pages:
   - Login and logout functionality
   - Contact and general information pages

### Views
All views have been migrated to Blade templates:
- AMP views in `resources/views/amp/`
- Bot views in `resources/views/bot/`
- General views in `resources/views/`

### Routes
All original CodeIgniter routes have been implemented in Laravel:
- Quran routes: `/`, `/juz/{juz}`, `/surah/{surah}`, `/ayah/{ayah}`, etc.
- Hadits routes: `/hadits/bukhari`, `/hadits/muslim`, etc.
- Bot routes: `/bot`, `/bot/ayah`, etc.
- General routes: `/login`, `/contact`, etc.

## Performance Optimizations
- Efficient file-based caching with automatic expiration
- JSON file indexing for faster data retrieval
- Optimized data loading for large collections

## Next Steps
1. Further optimize caching mechanisms
2. Implement lazy loading for large data sets
3. Add additional performance monitoring
4. Consider implementing Redis caching for production environments

## Accessing the Application
The application is now available through your Laragon setup. All functionality from the original CodeIgniter application has been preserved while benefiting from Laravel's modern architecture and features.

## Conclusion
The migration from CodeIgniter to Laravel has been successfully completed while maintaining all existing functionality. The application now benefits from Laravel's robust features while maintaining the file-based caching approach as requested.
